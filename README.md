## Hello! âœ¨ I'm Bryan! âœ¨

I'm a game developer and software engineer specializing in C#, but I also do work in VB.NET, Python, TypeScript, and C++!  

This GitHub page houses several projects I've worked on or am still actively working on. 

## Where can I find you? ðŸ‘€

I'm on Discord at MegaMasterX#6321.   Twitter @MegaMasterX.  [Also on Cohost!](https://cohost.org/MegaMasterX)

## What's ColonelBot?

ColonelBot is a Discord bot I developed for the N1 Grand Prix competitive MegaMan Battle Network community.  It's had several revisions since it was introduced around 2016 and the current version, 4, is the most recent.

ColonelBot is responsible for commands to help the community quickly access game information for MegaMan Battle Network 6 as well as some in-house back room tasks that are required to produce the events the community holds!

For more information, please check the Readme for that repo.

## What are these weird game repos?

I enjoy competing in the Ludum Dare game jams!  These repos are read only and are never actively maintained by me, they're more meant to just be an archive of past work.  They don't contain everything needed to completely build the projects in whatever game engine they're built in.
